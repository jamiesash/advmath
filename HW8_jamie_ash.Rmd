## Part 1: Toulmin Analysis

*In your own words, what is meant in the paper by "data"? By "claim"? By "warrant"? By "backing"?*

**Data** is a accepted truths, axioms, or statements that 
have been previously proven to be true, like lemons. Similarly previews 
statemnts of a proof that have been proven true and relevant fit this bill. 

**Warrants** are miniature propositions, and are used to show
a logical step from the data to the claim. Backings are additional warrants or 
data that is provided if the a current warrant is not initially accepted as 
true by the demographic. Backings can be provided preemptively. 

A **claim** is a statement or proposition that is being presented as true. 
Claims can become data for the preseding warrant.  

*Pick two of the "Sample Proofs" on the worksheet attached, one that you think is 
good and one that is bad. Do a Toulmin analysis on these two proofs, giving the 
claim, data, and warrant for each step.*

**Proposition 2, proof 2b, good proof:**  

Step 1: 
data: "Assume $\sqrt{15} \leq \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{6}$"  
warrant: "Then... square both sides"
claim: $\sqrt{15} \leq (\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{6})^2 = 8 + 2 \sqrt{12}$

Step 2: 
data: $\sqrt{15} \leq (\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{6})^2 = 8 + 2 \sqrt{12}$  
warrant: Subtract 8 from both sides  
claim: $7 \leq 2 \sqrt{12}$  

Step 3: 
data: $7 \leq 2 \sqrt{12}$  
warrant: Square both sides
claim: $49 < 48$  

Step 3: 
data: $49 < 48$   
warrant: This is a contradiction...
claim: ...so we must have $\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{6} < \sqrt{15}$

I liked this proof because the data for each warrant was the claim from the 
previous statement, so not much digging was needed. After doing the Toulmin 
analysis I liked the proof a little less, only because the first set of data - 
warrant - claim didn't have the same structure as the preseding data - warrant - 
claim. That is, it had an equal sign in the statement rather than putting the 
result in the next line below. 

**Question 1, proof 1A, bad proof:**

Step 1:
data: no data  
warent: $n = (2k) = (2k)^2 = 4k$  
claim: so itâ€™s divisible by 4  

The proof does not provide sufficient data for the warrant $(2k)^2 = 4k$. A 
definition of even numbers would be useful, and the assertion that $k \in Z$ is 
needed. The major gap is that $k$ is undefined. Furthermore the claim "so it's
divisible by 4" is ambiguous. It is difficult to discern what "it's" represents. 





## Part 2: Combinatorial Proofs:

*The classwork on Combinatorial Proofs is attached. Choose one question from 
1 to 6 and carefully write up the proof.*
