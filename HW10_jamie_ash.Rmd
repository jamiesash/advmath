# Part 1: Paradox

I did not come up with this, but also didn't just google it. 

An omnipotent god creates a stone that they can't lift. 
What happens if they try to lift the stone?

# Part 2: Sets and Congruents

**Sets and power sets:**

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
f = function(set) { 
  n = length(set)
  masks = 2^(1:n-1)
  lapply(1:2^n-1, function(u) set[bitwAnd(u, masks) != 0] )
}
#f(LETTERS[1:4])
```

**Computations:**

*Question 3:* Find 3 different values of $x$, then describe all integers that 
satisfy the congruence.   
     1. $x \equiv 1 (\mod2)$   
     2. $x \equiv 0 (\mod5)$  
     3. $x \equiv 3 (\mod10)$   

**Proofs:**

*Question 5:* If n is odd, then $8 | (n^2-1)$. 

# Part 3: Reflection

I woke up in the middle of the night, and could not fall back asleep. I kept 
thinking "what am I doing with my life".
