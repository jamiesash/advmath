So far so good. I enjoy the structure of the class, am able to keep up with the 
readings and the course work.     

I just did really bad on my first calculus test of the semester. I felt like I 
could have answered most of the questions well, but ran out of time. I'm really 
good at making arithmetic mistakes that lead me down the wrong path for a very 
long time. I'm still pretty rusty. So I appreciate that this class does not have 
exams.
