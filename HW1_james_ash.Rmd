Write at least one (typed) page answering the following questions. Note: none of your responses will be shared with others, only your instructors will read them.

  Reflect on Week 1 of class: How did it go? Is there anything you're uneasy about? Anything we should know?
  
  Tell us about a time in your life when you have felt successful in mathematics.

  Tell us about a time when you have felt defeated in mathematics.

  Any questions you have for us?



I'm really happy with the first week of class. 

I've registered for both calculus $III$ and introduction to advanced mathmatics. 
I have not taken math courses in a long time, and I'm concerend I will not be 
able to do well in either class. 

For calculus III, I know what to expect. I think of it as apart of the 
"engineering" math group. This group includes the other calculus classes, linear 
algebra, and differentail equations. All similarly stick to an age old 
itinerary, that consists of a heavy work load with marathon homework 
assignemnts.

Advanced mathmatics is a bit of a wild card. I've never taken any proof based 
course, or set theary, number theary etc (I still think a pile can't have zero 
elements). 

Unless you consider statistic courses math courses.
