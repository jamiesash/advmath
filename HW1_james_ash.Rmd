I'm really happy with the first week of class. It has gone well. Alot of work 
but hopefully I'll be able to keep up. 

I'm uneasy about taking math classes this semester. I've registered for both 
calculus $III$ and introduction to advanced mathematics. I have not taken math 
courses in a long time, and I'm concerned I will not be able to do well in 
either class. 

For calculus III, I know what to expect. I think of it as apart of the 
"engineering" math group. This group includes the other calculus classes, linear 
algebra, and differential equations. All similarly have a heavy work load, with 
marathon length homework assignments. I think if I had a lot of time on my hands 
I could do well, but I'm pretty busy.

Introduction to advanced mathematics is a bit of a wild card. I've never taken 
any proof based course, set theory, or number theory class. I really don't know 
what to expect. So far I really like the class, and I'm actually excited to read 
the textbook. I also like the grading scheme. I recently read this book 
*the dispossessed* where an anarchist physicist from a moon goes on to lecture 
a course at a "propertarian" (people who own property) university on the planet 
his moon orbits. The anarchist is all like "What the hell are grades?". That's 
how I feel about grades now.

I'm trying to finish my masters degree this semester, and will either be 
defending late October or early November. I'll be pretty bogged down around 
that time.  

I felt successful in mathematics when I did well in OCN 320 Advanced 
Mathematics. It's completely different from the math departments advanced math 
class. OCN 320 has no proofs. It covers pretty broad topics from calculus to 
linear algebra and differential equations. It's meant for SOEST graduate 
students who are coming into the program without the proper undergraduate math 
course prerequisites (such as myself). I did get a good grade, but I was mostly 
happy about it being the first higher level math course that I completed and 
understood all of what was taught. 

I felt defeated in math the first semester I went back to school after taking a 
hiatus. I registered for calculus II my first semester. At the time I was living 
with my grandmother (nana) and commuting from southern Rhode Island to Boston by 
train (the T or commuter rail). I had a breakdown on the commuter rail on my way 
home. I'm usually pretty collected, so it was concerning. I ended up dropping 
calculus II, and to this day have not completed the course.
