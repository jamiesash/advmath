**Question 1.** Prove each of the following. I each case, you should create a 
bijection between the two sets.Briefly justify that your function are in fact 
bijections.  

(a) $\{ \heartsuit,  \clubsuit, \spadesuit \} = \{ \circ, \square, \triangle \}$  

(b) $\mathbb{N} = \{odd natural numbers\}$

(c) $A \times \{ 1 \} =  A$, where $A$ is any set. 

**Question 2.** Let $\digamma$ denote the set of all functions from $\mathbb{N}$
to $\{0, 1\}$. 

(a) Describe at least three functions in the set $\digamma$.

(b) Prove that $\mid \digamma \mid = \mid P(\mathbb{N}) \mid$.  

Use multiplicatory rule to show $\mid \digamma \mid = 2^{\mid \mathbb{N} \mid}$.
*Note: a function with the same input and same out put is an equal function.
so there's $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times ... \times n$ where n is the last natural
number. 

elements in $\mathbb{N} = \{1,2,3...n\}$  
options for each element = $\{ (0,1)_1, (0,1)_2, (0,1)_3...(0,1)_n \}$


**Question 3.** Let $X$ be a set. Prove that "it has the same cardinality as" is 
an equivalence relation on $P(X)$. 

**Question 4.** Prove or disprove: The set $\{a_1, a_2, a_3 ... a_i: a \in \mathbb{Z}\}$
of infinite sequence of integers is countably infinite. 

**Question 5:** Prove that $A$ and $B$ are finite sets with $\mid A \mid = \mid B \mid$,
then any injection $f: A \rightarrow B$ is also a surjection. Show this is not 
necessarily true if $A$ and $B$ are not finite.
