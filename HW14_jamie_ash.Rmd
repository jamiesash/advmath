**Question 1.** Prove each of the following. I each case, you should create a 
bijection between the two sets.Briefly justify that your function are in fact 
bijections.  

(a) $\mid \{ \heartsuit,  \clubsuit, \spadesuit \}\mid = \mid \{ \circ, \square, \triangle \} \mid$  

(b) $\mid \mathbb{N} \mid = \mid \{odd natural numbers\}\mid$

(c) $\mid A \times \{ 1 \} \mid =  \mid A \mid$, where $A$ is any set. 

**Question 2.** Let $\digamma$ denote the set of all functions from $\mathbb{N}$
to $\{0, 1\}$. 

(a) Describe at least three functions in the set $\digamma$. 

$f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$ where $f(x) = x *0$, or $f(x) = x^0$, or 
$f(x) = \{$if x is even assign a 1, if x is odd assign a 0$\}$.  

(b) Prove that $\mid \digamma \mid = \mid P(\mathbb{N}) \mid$.  


*Proof*  We proceed by proof of equivalent cases (I am making this term up I 
think). First I will show that $\mid \digamma \mid =  2^{\mid \mathbb{N} \mid}$. 
Then I will show that $\mid P(\mathbb{N}) \mid = 2^{\mid \mathbb{N} \mid}$

*case 1.* By the definition of equal functions, for each element 
$n \in \mathbb{N}$ there are only two possible functions that can send 
$n  \rightarrow \{0 ,1\}$. So then given the multiplcatory rule of combinitorics 
(pg. 69 of textbook), there are $2^{\mid \mathbb{N} \mid}$ functions that can 
send $\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$. Thus 
$\mid \digamma \mid =  2^{\mid \mathbb{N} \mid}$.  

*case 2.*  In class we showed that 
$\mid P(\mathbb{N}) \mid = 2^{\mid \mathbb{N} \mid}$.   

Therefore $\mid P(\mathbb{N}) \mid = 2^{\mid \mathbb{N} \mid} = \mid \digamma \mid$,
meaning $\mid P(\mathbb{N}) \mid = \mid \digamma \mid$.

**Question 3.** Let $X$ be a set. Prove that "it has the same cardinality as" is 
an equivalence relation on $P(X)$. 

**Question 4.** Prove or disprove: The set $\{a_1, a_2, a_3 ... a_i: a \in \mathbb{Z}\}$
of infinite sequence of integers is countably infinite. 

**Question 5:** Prove that $A$ and $B$ are finite sets with $\mid A \mid = \mid B \mid$,
then any injection $f: A \rightarrow B$ is also a surjection. Show this is not 
necessarily true if $A$ and $B$ are not finite. 

*Direct proof!!! (p.s. I do not have all my direct proof check marks)*...  
Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are finite sets with $\mid A \mid = \mid B \mid$.     
Then the number of inductive functions that can be made from $A$ to $B$ 
$f: A \rightarrow B$, is described using the binomial function 
$\binom{\mid A \mid}{\mid B \mid}$. Similarly, the number of bijective functions
from $A \rightarrow B$ is given by $\binom{\mid B \mid}{\mid A \mid}$.   
Since $A$ and $B$ are of equal cardinality, then $\binom{\mid B \mid}{\mid A \mid}$ 
= $\binom{\mid A \mid}{\mid B \mid}$.  
Thus the number of injective relationships equals the number of bijective 
relationships.   
This means all injective functions between $A$ and $B$ are 
surjective.     
Therefore any injection, $f: A \rightarrow B$, is also a surjection. 

*Note: When describing the number of bijective functions as $\binom{\mid A \mid}{\mid B \mid}$,
if $\mid A \mid < \mid B \mid$ then $\binom{\mid A \mid}{\mid B \mid} = 0$,
which agrees with the pigeon hole principle that if $\mid A \mid < \mid B \mid$ 
then there is no surjective function from $A$ to $B$, and thus no bijective 
function from $A$ to $B$.
