*Question 4.* 

**Rewriting question.** 
for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we can write write it as $n = 2^{x_1}+2^{x_2}+...2^{x_i}$ 
where $x_0$ to $x_{i}$ are elements of the set $x \in P(\mathbb{N})$. 

(Base case) Showing 1 to 7 can be writen as $2^{x_1}+2^{x_2}+...2^{x_i}$. 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
raise = function(x){
  sum(2^x) 
}

# first few natural numbers
n = 0:2
# produce the power set of n
sets = powerSet(n, rev=TRUE)
# raise by 2 and sum each subset of n (in the powerset)
u = lapply(sets, raise)
# Just changing the data class to vector (from a list), and sriting them 
u = unlist(u)
sort(u)
```

Let $X$ be the set $\{x \in P(\mathbb{N});2^{x_1}+2^{x_2}+...2^{x_i} \}$. 
Suppose for the sake of argument that there is some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ where
$n \notin X$.  

Let $k$ be this number, and $t$ be the greatest factor of two that is less 
than $k$, and $\ell$ be the smallest factor of two greater than $k$. Such that
$t < k < \ell$ and $2t = \ell$.   

Then $k - t = m$ and $k = m + t$ where $m \in \mathbb{N}$, and $m < t < k$.  
Since $m < t < k$ and $k$ is the smallest number not in $X$, it follows that 
$t,m \in X$.  

Similarly, because $t > m$, then $t + m \in X$. 
Note, if it where the case where $m > t$ then $\ell$ would be the greatest 
factor of two that is less than $k$, not $t$.    
So $t + m = k$ and $t + m \in X$ but $k \notin X$. This is a contradiction.   
Therefore, $\forall n \in X$.
